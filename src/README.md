## Use cases

#### Use case #1

One of the developers has noticed a bug in the companyâ€™s product.
He starts the application and goes on to create a new Task for it.
He creates a new Bug and gives it the title "The program freezes when the Log In button is clicked."
For the description he adds "This needs to be fixed quickly!", he marks the Bug as High priority and
gives it Critical severity. Since it is a new bug, it gets the Active status.
The developer also assigns it to the senior developer in the team. To be able to fix the bug,
the senior developer needs to know how to reproduce it, so the developer who logged the bug
adds a list of steps to reproduce: "1. Open the application; 2. Click "Log In"; 3. The application freezes!"
The bug is saved to the application and is ready to be fixed.

#### Use case #2

A new developer has joined the team. One of the other developers starts the application and creates a
new team member. After that, he adds the new team member to one of the existing teams and assigns all
Critical bugs to him.

#### Use case #3

One of the developers has fixed a bug that was assigned to him. He adds a comment to that bug,
saying "This one took me a while, but it is fixed now!", and then changes the status of the bug to Done.
Just to be sure, he checks the changes history list of the bug and sees that the last entry in the list
says, "The status of item with ID 42 switched from Active to Done."

## Constraints

You should implement the empty classes. You can add new classes where needed and modify any of the existing code under
the **models** package if necessary.

## Unit Tests

- You have been given unit tests to keep track of your progress. Run them by right-clicking the **tests** package and
  selecting **Run 'All Tests'**.
- If you get stuck, check out the tests' names to guide you on what to do.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Follow the OOP best practices**:

    - Use data encapsulation.
    - Use inheritance and polymorphism properly.
    - Use interfaces and abstract classes properly.
    - Use static members properly.
    - Use enumerations properly.
    - Aim for strong cohesion and loose coupling.

2. **Follow guidelines for writing clean code**:
    - Proper naming of classes, methods, and fields.
    - Small classes and methods.
    - Well formatted and consistent code.
    - No duplicate code.

3. **Implement proper user input validation and display meaningful user messages**.
4. **Implement proper exception handling**.
5. **Prefer using the Streaming API, then using ordinary loops, wherever you can**.
6. **Cover the core functionality with unit tests (at least 80% code coverage of the models and commands)**.
7. **Use Git to keep your source code and for team collaboration**.
